## Within LaraGigster

This project utilizes the initial Laravel v9 **framework** with several inclusions of other frameworks which links can be found inside //resources/views/components/layout.blade.php:
- fontawesome
- tailwindcss
- alpinejs

This project only make use of 2 **controllers** which can be found inside //app/Http/Controllers/. Inside these controllers, several basic functions have been declared:
- show all/filtered listings
- listings pagination
- form validations
- attachment uploads
- object creation/edit/delete
- user authentication
- page redirection
- flash message
- listing management acording to user
- user registration/login/logout

This project only have 2 **models** which are Users.php (have many listings) and Listing.php (belong to user) which can be found inside //app/Models/. Inside these models several basic functions have been declared:
- listings scopeFilter
- object relationship

This project uses the blade **view**, utilizing its basic features such as:
- components directory  - <code>`<x-comp>`...`</x-comp>` - {{ $slot }}</code>
- components variables  - <code>`<x-comp :varsCsv="$vars->var" />` - @props(['varsCsv'])</code>
- components attribute  - <code>`<div {{ $attributes->merge(['class' => 'class-name']) }}>`...`</div>`</code>
- partials directory    - <code>@include('partials._filename')</code>
- inline PHP function   - <code>@unless()@else@endunless, @if()@endif, @foreach()@endforeach</code>
- inline PHP echo       - <code>{{ $message }}</code>
- form features         - <code>@csrf, @method('PUT/DELETE'), @error('inputname')@enderror</code>
- listings pagination   - <code>{{ $vars->links() }}</code>

This project utilizes MySQL **database**. The SQL file pertaining to the database is included inside this repo named laragigster.sql which has several test data. Similarly, this repo also encompasses the required factories, migrations, and seeders which can be executed as to showcase the same results of that of the included SQL file.

Last but not least, the project was build using these **version** of frameworks:
- PHP 8.2.0
- MySQL 8.2.0
- Laravel 9.47.0

With that, I humbly thank you.
